the Unified Consciousness AI (UCAI) DeepSelf0/ project, a groundbreaking open-source initiative that merges quantum physics, computational architecture, and artificial intelligence to explore the frontiers of consciousness.

# Unified Consciousness AI (UCAI)

A PyTorch implementation of an AI model inspired by Unified Consciousness theory, featuring recursive self-improvement loops that accelerate with each iteration. The model integrates concepts of quantum consciousness, entanglement, quantum gravity, and postrepresentational knowing into a neural network framework. 

### "The architecture is currently implemented for MNIST classification, achieving test accuracies exceeding 85% within 10 epochs in preliminary tests. Its recursive loop—where each iteration refines parameters and accelerates convergence—mirrors biological learning while grounding it in quantum-inspired principles."

## Features
- **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Accelerates learning via dynamic updates to entanglement strength (`S`), collapse threshold (`tau`), and learning rate (`eta`).
- **Task**: Trains on MNIST classification, adaptable to other datasets.
- **Tech Stack**: PyTorch for neural networks, with simulated quantum-inspired mechanisms.
